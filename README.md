# Picard

Picard is a starter theme for WordPress that makes use of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and the new [WP-API](http://wp-api.org/) which, at some point, will be going into WordPress core.

## Getting Started

You can run this theme right away by [downloading the compiled version of the theme](http://picardtheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/picard.zip). You'll just need to download, install and activate the WP-API plugin by following [these instructions](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master#installation).

If you want to start developing with this theme, you'll need to:

1. Clone this repo to your computer (e.g. `git clone git@github.com:Automattic/Picard.git`)
1. Run `npm install` to install the node dependencies
1. Run `gulp js` to compile the JavaScript
